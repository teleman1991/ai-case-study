# AI Transcribing with Zoom

## Overview and Origin

- **Company**: Zoom
- **Incorporation**: 2011
- **Location**: San Jose, CA
- **Founder**: Eric Yuan

The idea for Zoom originated from Eric Yuan's frustration with the shortcomings of existing video conferencing solutions, particularly Cisco's WebEx, where he worked as a vice president of engineering. Yuan envisioned a video conferencing platform that prioritized simplicity, reliability, and affordability, addressing the issues he encountered with other services. Dissatisfied with the complexity and performance issues of existing solutions, Yuan left Cisco to start Zoom in April 2011. His vision was to create a platform that would revolutionize virtual communication and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise or budget constraints. Zoom has primarily been funded through venture capital investments. Since its founding, Zoom has raised significant funding through various rounds of financing. As of January 2022, Zoom had raised over $146 million in venture capital funding across multiple rounds. However, it's worth noting that this figure may have changed since then, as the company continued to grow and attract investment. Additionally, Zoom went public in April 2019 with an initial public offering (IPO), which further contributed to its funding and allowed it to raise capital from public investors. Overall, the combination of venture capital funding and proceeds from its IPO has provided Zoom with the financial resources to support its growth and expansion as a leading video conferencing platform.

## Business Activities

Zoom's AI transcription feature addresses several challenges in virtual meetings:
1. **Accessibility**: It makes meetings more accessible to individuals with hearing impairments or language barriers by converting spoken dialogue into text.
2. **Note-taking and reference**: Transcription provides a written record of discussions and decisions, aiding participants in reviewing important points later and capturing action items accurately.
3. **Searchability**: Transcription enables users to search meeting recordings based on keywords and phrases, facilitating the retrieval of specific information.
4. **Improved comprehension**: It aids comprehension by providing a written record of conversations, especially useful for understanding accents, speech patterns, or technical jargon.
5. **Remote collaboration**: Transcription helps bridge communication gaps in remote teams by providing a clear, written record of discussions, ensuring all team members can participate fully regardless of their location.

## Landscape

- **Field**: Video Conferencing
- **Major Trends**: Over the last 5-10 years, major trends in the video conferencing field include:

## Recommendations

If I were to advise Zoom, I would suggest expanding its AI capabilities to include real-time translation services. This product would benefit the company by further enhancing communication and collaboration among global teams and participants who speak different languages. The technologies utilized for this service would include natural language processing (NLP), machine learning algorithms for translation, and integration with Zoom's existing platform. These technologies are appropriate because they would leverage Zoom's existing infrastructure and expertise in AI-powered features, while also addressing a growing need for multilingual communication in today's globalized world.
